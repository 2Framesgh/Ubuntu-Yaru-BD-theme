# Ubuntu-Yaru-BD-theme (IN DEVELOPMENT)
A Better Discord theme inspired by Ubuntu's Yaru theme, and to make the client match the theme of Ubuntu
This theme is based on GitHub dark, found at https://betterdiscord.app/theme/GitHub%20Dark as I'm too lazy to write it of scratch as this is my first theme...
# Installation
Just copy and paste the CSS of the `Ubd.css` file into your Better Discord custom CSS, and you should be done!
