# Ubuntu-Yaru-BD-theme (IN DEVELOPMENT)
A Better Discord theme inspired by Ubuntu's Yaru theme, and to make the client match the theme of Ubuntu
This theme is based on GitHub dark, found at https://betterdiscord.app/theme/GitHub%20Dark as I'm too lazy to write it of scratch as this is my first theme...
Also as a reminder, Discord client modifications are against the terms of service, I am not responsible for the suspension of your account, but Discord really does not care about client modifications.
# Installation
Just copy and paste the CSS of the `Ubd.css` file into your Better Discord custom CSS, and you should be done! You can also do it with Stylus if you prefer to use a web browser.
